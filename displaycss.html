    <!-- block property takes up the full width of window and if there is any 
    other element after that block one, then it is automatically going to take the 
    second line. Dosent matters the length of element or content in block, it is going 
    to take the full width of the window.
    inline is just the opposite of block, no matter what the size of content of inline element is 
    it will only take that much space as it is required by the content the next element and so on 
    will take the same line (inline) as long as the width of the window allows so -->
    <!-- we cant set the height and width in inline because it will automatically take the width required 
    to fit in the content. But in block property it is allowed. -->
    <!-- inline-block have the property of seting height and width and due to inline also it 
    can come in same line. Best of both. -->
